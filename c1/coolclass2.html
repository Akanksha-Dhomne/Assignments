        <h2 class="cold">Feeling Cool </h2>
        <p>Have you always wanted to be the cool guy, who always seems to do the right 
           thing and flows through life with ease and grace? Or are you learning to be the 
           chill person, who never seems stressed or nervous and has an air of confidence? 
           If you think about all the people who you think of as cool and collected, you'll 
           find that they have several characteristics in common: they're all confident, 
           unique, and generally on friendly terms with everyone; there's no reason you 
           can't be like that yourself. There is really no true universal definition of how 
           to be cool, but here are some guidelines to get you started.
        </p>
        <h3>Act Like You Don't Care</h3>
        <p>We will always, on some level, be concerned with others' opinions of ourselves, 
           but realize that ultimately, you will never be able to please everyone, so why bother
           trying? People have millions of ways to get under youe skin. Learn to spot them and become
           immune. Be happy and have fun.
        </p>
        <h3>Learn to Laugh...At You!</h3>
        <p>Being Cool doesn't mean being perfect, and being able to find humor in your moments of
           clumsiness and discomfort is the defining hallmark of being cool. People will not only 
           respect you for it, but they'll like you for being human, just like them.
        </p>
        <h3>Tip:</h3>
        <p>"Be still and cool in thine own mind and spirit."</p>

        <h1>definition of Cool</h1>
        <p>To be cool is a very ambiguous attribute in the sense that it can have many 
           forms depending on the context in which it is being referenced to the meaning 
           behind being cool differs from person to person because each person has a 
           different perspective on what they view as being cool. There is no single 
           concept of cool. One of the essential characteristics of cool is that it is 
           able to mutate and changes or varies over time and among the different cultures 
           and generations. The only constant aspect is that being cool is seen as positive 
           and highly desirable, but in what way does the consumption of stuff contribute to 
           being cool? Is the desire of being cool a contributing factor in motivating people
           to consume stuff? Mankind create only to provide for others and to make their lives 
           and everyone else’s’ lives around them easier to live, but is satisfying our basic 
           needs to only reason for consumerism?

        <h2>How to be cool?</h2>
        <p>Have you always wanted to be the cool guy, who always seems to do the 
           right thing and flows through life with ease and grace? Or are you 
           learning to be the chill person, who never seems stressed or nervous 
           and has an air of confidence? If you think about all the people who
           you think of as cool and collected, you'll find that they have several 
           characteristics in common: they're all confident, unique, and generally
           on friendly terms with everyone; there's no reason you can't be like that
           yourself. There is really no true universal definition of how to be cool,
           but here are some guidelines to get you started.
        </p>
        <h2 class="hot">Being cool</h2>
        <p><b>First: Don't be needy</b> Remember, people who are cool are not needy or desperate.
           Instead, try to solve problems yourself whenever you can. If you are not needy,
           people will want to help you or will ask for your help. This quality attracts people.
           Neediness is a big turn off unless you're really in a tight spot. This doesn't
           mean you should act invincible; just don't beg people for help, act like you can't
           be alone, or expect others to fix your problems.
        </p>
        <p><b>Second: Be yourself</b> It will be something that other people will look up to.
           You are unique, and you don't need to join a clique. Make your own friendships.
           Being cool is being yourself in an outgoing way, even if you are quiet. Just
           remember not to come off as sullen and passive-aggressive. Be true to yourself!
           Don't always try to be like anyone else by copying someone else's actions or style.
           Although trying out those acts is fine, if you do that on a regular basis, it's
           going to come out as fake. No good comes out of being someone you are not. 
           Live life for who you are. Don't lose sight of yourself or your morals. Being 
           cool isn't about changing who you are, it's about being confident enough to let 
           people see how awesome you really are. Remember, an original is always worth more 
           than a copy. Be true to who you are and don't devalue yourself.
        </p>
        <p><b>Third: Practice self-disclosure</b> The more you disclose yourself the better
           you understand yourself. Self-disclosure is both the conscious and subconscious 
           act of revealing more about oneself to others. This may include, but is not 
           limited to: thoughts, feelings, aspirations, goals, failures, successes, fears, 
           dreams as well as one's likes, dislikes and favorites.
        </p>
